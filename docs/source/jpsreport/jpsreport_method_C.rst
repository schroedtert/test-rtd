The density

.. math:: \langle \rho \rangle_{\Delta x}

\ is defined as the number of pedestrians divided by the area of the
measurement section:

.. math:: \langle \rho \rangle_{\Delta x}=\frac{N}{b_\text{cor}\cdot\Delta x}.

The spatial mean velocity is the average of the instantaneous velocities

.. math:: v_i(t)

\ for all pedestrians in the measurement area at time

.. math:: t

:

.. math:: \langle v \rangle_{\Delta x}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}{v_i(t)}.
